# react-native-amazon-clone_mobile-app
Mobile clone of Amazon with React Native. Nodejs Expressjs was used in the backend. MongoDB was used as the database. JWT was used. Nodemailer was used. After user registration, the activation link will be sent to your real e-mail address.

Before running the application, run npm install in the main folder and api folder. To test the virtual emulator with Android Studio, make sure you share the ports correctly and identically. If you get an error, use your computer's IP instead of localhost. Enter the activation email into the function called Transporter in the index.js file in the API. You must type the e-mail address that will send the e-mail. To do this, go to the Security section of your Google account, activate the verification code in two steps, create an application password and add that password to the password section in the transporter function in the API folder.
